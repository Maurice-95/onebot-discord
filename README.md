# Onebot - Discord bot.

Hey, I'm Onebot! ðŸ’¥ A (simple) multi-purpose Discord bot written in Python on the Discord.py library. I'm open-source, feel free to use me on your server!

This is my first Python project build as a learning process. I've started with my first language Python on June 2025.

Type /help for a list of all available commands.
